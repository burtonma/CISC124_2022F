    "# Creating an interface\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are a number of situations in software engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a \"contract\" that\n",
    "> spells out how their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other group's code is\n",
    "> written. Generally speaking, interfaces are such contracts.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For example, imagine a futuristic society where computer-controlled robotic cars transport passengers through city streets without a human operator.\n",
    "> Automobile manufacturers write software (Java, of course) that operates the automobileâ€”stop, start, accelerate, turn left, and so forth. Another\n",
    "> industrial group, electronic guidance instrument manufacturers, make computer systems that receive GPS (Global Positioning System) position data and\n",
    "> wireless transmission of traffic conditions and use that information to drive the car.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The auto manufacturers must publish an industry-standard interface that spells out in detail what methods can be invoked to make the car move (any\n",
    "> car, from any manufacturer). The guidance manufacturers can then write software that invokes the methods described in the interface to command the\n",
    "> car. Neither industrial group needs to know how the other group's software is implemented. In fact, each group considers its software highly\n",
    "> proprietary and reserves the right to modify it at any time, as long as it continues to adhere to the published interface.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> [The Java Tutorials: Interfaces](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The quote above alludes to the fact that interfaces are one mechanism in Java for managing complexity. Distributing an interface\n",
    "allows any other programmer in the world to create a class that is compatible with the interface. Similarly, a program that uses\n",
    "interfaces for its types can potentially use any class that implements the required interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have already seen, classes that implement data structures often implement one or more interfaces. For example, Java's `List`,\n",
    "`Set`, and `Map` interfaces describe the behaviour of the different kinds of lists, sets, and maps found in the Standard Library.\n",
    "A programmer can create a different kind of list that implements the `List` interface and share their work with the rest\n",
    "of the world; any other programmer familiar with the `List` interface can immediately use the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Declaring an interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring an interface is very similar to declaring a class. A top-level interface is an interface that is not defined inside another class or interface.\n",
    "A top-level interface declaration looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "modifiers interface InterfaceName {\n",
    "    // inside the braces is called the interface body\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where *modifiers* are optional interface modifiers described below, `interface` is a keyword indicating the interface declaration, and `InterfaceName` is the name of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, an interface name must begin with what is referred to as a *Java letter*. A Java letter includes the characters A-Z, a-z, and for historical reasons the dollar sign `$` and the underscore character `_`; Java letters also include Unicode characters corresponding to letters in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, interface names are written using [upper camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case): The first letter of the interface name is capitalized, the remaining letters of the name are in lowercase except for multi-word class names where each word also begins with a capital letter. For example, the interface name `SortedSet` is used instead of `sortedset`, `Sorted_Set`, `sortedSet` or any other variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining characters in a class name can be made up of any number of Java letters or any *Java digits*. A Java digit includes the digits 0-9 and Unicode characters corresponding to digits in other languages."

    "## Interface modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "In a top-level interface, the legal interface modifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public`\n",
    "- `abstract`\n",
    "- `strictfp` (we will not use this modifier in any other notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, the only modifier that is relevant to our purposes is the modifier `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `public` interface is visible to all other classes and interfaces. The modifier is optional; all top-level interfaces have public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abstract` modifier is considered obsolete and should no longer be used. All interfaces are considered abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifier `strictfp` is used to indicate that the methods of the interface are *FP-strict* which forces all floating-point calculations performed inside the class to adhere to the IEEE754 floating-point standards; this guarantees that floating-point calculations will always yield the same result regardless of the computing platform. On modern computing hardware likely to run Java this no longer seems to be an issue; see [this Java Enhancement Proposal](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/306) for some discussion."

    "\n",
    "An interface describes the behaviour *but not the structure* of an implementing class; thus, an interface is not allowed to declare instance fields.\n",

    "An interface is allowed to define constants using `public static final` fields because such fields are considered to be part of the public facing programming interface of a class."

    "## Interface methods\n",
    "\n",
    "An interface describes the public facing programming interface for an implementing class. By default, all methods in an interface have `public` access and it is a compile-time error if an interface method has `protected` or `private` access. If a method has no access modifier then the method has `public` access (not package private access!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most methods in an interface have no implementation and are said to be *abstract methods*. Such method declarations in an interface end with a semi-colon `;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 added two other types of methods to appear in interfaces: static methods and default methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 was the first Java version to allow static methods in an interface. Interface static methods are identical to class static methods except that all methods in an interface have public access. Static interface methods are implemented within the interface (thus they have method bodies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Allowing static methods in interfaces reduces the need for utility classes. For example, all of the methods that operate on lists in the `Collections` utility class can be replaced by static methods in the `List` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Default methods\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem with previous versions of Java interfaces is that once an interface was released for widespread use it became extremely difficult to add new methods to the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1** Why is it difficult to make changes to a widely used interface? (answer follows below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 8 was the first Java version to allow methods to provide an implementation in an interface through the use of *default* methods. A default method is an interface method that has an implementation. Default methods were added to the Java language because it was realized that many existing interfaces needed new methods to support new features that were to be added to the Java language. If the existing interfaces were updated without default methods then every class that implemented an interface would need to be updated as well; this includes classes created by every Java programmer in world and not just the standard library classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because default methods have an implementation, they can be added to existing interfaces without needing to update every class that implements the updated interface.\n",
    "\n",
