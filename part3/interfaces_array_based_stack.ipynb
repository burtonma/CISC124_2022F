The problem with omitting the statement is that it is possible in a running program that the array value at `this.arr[this.top]` is never overwritten in which case the array will contain a reference to an element that is no longer in the stack. The Java garbage collector will be unable to free the memory associated with the (potentially unused) element. For a single element this is not a great concern but imagine the situation where a user pushes millions of elements on to a stack and then pops all of the elements from the stack; furthermore, imagine that the user's program eventually releases all of the element references. The millions of objects that are no longer required by the program cannot be garbage collected from memory if the stack array is still storing references to the elements. \n",
