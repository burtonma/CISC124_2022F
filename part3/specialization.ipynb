    "In inheritance, a subclass is allowed to *specialize* its superclass by adding new features, such as fields and methods, to the ones inherited from the superclass. A subclass may also change the behaviour of a method inherited from any one of its superclasses by re-implementing the method. When a subclass re-implements an inherited method we say that the subclass *overrides* the inherited method. We've already seen examples of overriding the `Object` methods `equals`, `hashCode`, and `equals`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure illustrates that classes become more specialized going down the inheritance hierarchy and more generalized going up the inheritance hierarchy.\n",

    "[`Object`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html) is the most general class in the entire Java language. It defines a type (`Object`) for all Java objects, and it defines a small number of methods that can be called using any object in Java. Other than that, it is not particularly useful and a programmer would probably never explicitly create an instance using `new Object()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`AbstractCollection`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractCollection.html) is a specialization of `Object` that provides a starting point for other programmers to create a collection class such as some kind of list or set. It adds several methods to the ones inherited from `Object` that are important for representing collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`AbstractList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractList.html) is a specialization of `AbstractCollection` that provides a starting point for programmers to create list-like objects. It adds methods to the ones inherited from its superclasses that are important for list operations. Not surprisingly, there is a sibling class named `AbstractSet` that provides a different specialization of `AbstractCollection` for programmers to create set-like objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Vector`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Vector.html) is a specialization of `AbstractList` that provides a list class similar to `ArrayList`. It adds fields needed to store and manage a list of objects and adds methods related to managing a list of elements. It also overrides methods inherited from its superclasses to make them more efficient; it can do this because `Vector` has knowledge about its own internal representation that its superclasses cannot know.\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Stack`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html) is a specialization of `Vector` that provides a representation of a stack data structure. It adds the methods `push` and `pop` that are part of the stack abstraction."
