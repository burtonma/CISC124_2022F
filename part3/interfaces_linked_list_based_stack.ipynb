    "# Interfaces: Linked list-based stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ArrayList`-based and array-based stack implementations have `push` operations that are in $O(1)$ amortized complexity; however, when the internal array holding the elements\n",
    "runs out of capacity, the array must be reallocated and its elements copied into the new array which leads to a worst-case $O(n)$ complexity. It is possible to achieve $O(1)$ worst-case\n",
    "complexity for `push`, but we cannot use an array to store the elements of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a stack having exactly one element: The string `\"A\"`. We can draw a picture of such a stack like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A stack with one element](../resources/images/stacks/linked-list-1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The box and arrow represents an object called a *node*. A node has a reference to an element (the string `\"A\"` in this case) and a reference to the next element in the sequence\n",
    "(called a *link* and represented by the arrow).\n",
    "Because the stack has only one element, there is no node for the next element; this is indicated by the arrow pointing to `null` (remember that in Java, `null` is the reference to no object).\n",
    "The node is shown in blue to indicate that it holds the top element of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we push the string `\"B\"` onto the top of the stack. Our stack now looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A stack with two elements](../resources/images/stacks/linked-list-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The node holding the `\"B\"` is now labelled `top` and its arrow points to the node holding the `\"A\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we push the string `\"C\"` onto the top of the stack. Our stack now looks like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A stack with three elements](../resources/images/stacks/linked-list-3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The node holding the `\"C\"` is now labelled `top` and its arrow points to the node holding the `\"B\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the nodes are linked in a linear structure. It is possible to reach any node in the sequence by starting from the `top` node and following the link to the next node in the\n",
    "sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure shown above is called a *singly linked list* because it represents a sequence of elements where each element is joined by one link.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "    Java's <tt>LinkedList</tt> is a doubly linked list. Each node has two links, one to the next node in the sequence and second to the previous node in the sequence.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing an element onto to the top of the stack always requires a constant number of elementary operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. make a new node to hold the element\n",
    "2. set the link of the new node to point to the current `top` node\n",
    "3. set `top` to refer to the new node\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the `push` operation has worst-case complexity $O(1)$ for a linked list-based stack.\n",
