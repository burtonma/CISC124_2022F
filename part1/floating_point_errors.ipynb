    "Kahan's algorithm keeps track of two running values:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `s` : the accumulated sum\n",
    "* `c` : the error caused by adding an element to the sum from the *previous* iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "When `c` is positive, the current sum is too large because of rounding error, and when `c` is negative, the current sum\n",
    "is too small because of rounding error. To compensate for the rounding error, `c` is subtracted from the next element that\n",
    "is added to the sum on the line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "float y = val - c;    // val is the next element to add to the sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`t` is a temporary value equal to the current sum plus `y`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "float t = s + y;      // add the next (error compensated) element to the sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `t` involves an arithmetic operation of floating-point values, it contains rounding error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key in Kahan's algorithm is in estimating how much rounding error has accumulated by adding `y` to the sum, which occurs on the \n",
    "line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "c = (t - s) - y;\n",

    "  & = (s + y - s) - y \\\\\n",
    "  & = y - y \\\\\n",
    "  & = 0\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the term `t` contains rounding error so that `(t - s)` is not exactly equal to `y`. In other words, mathematically:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c = y' - y$$\n",

    "where $y' \\approx (y + \\text{rounding error caused by computing}\\ s + y)$. Subtracting $y$ from $y'$ yields an approximate\n",
    "estimate of the rounding error caused by adding the most recent element to the sum.\n",
    "This rounding error is subtracted from the next element at the beginning of the next loop iteration before adding it the sum.\n",
