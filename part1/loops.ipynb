The moving average is used because it smooths out short-term fluctuations so that longer-term trends can be seen more easily. In a 5-day moving average, the value of the moving average on day $i$ is the average of the number of cases on days $i-2$, $i-1$, $i$, $i+1$, and $i+2$. The following cell contains the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Ontario from May 10 to May 19, 2020.

A run-length encoded array of integers is an array having an even number of elements (2 or greater).

For example, the compressed array `[4, 1000, 7, 1050, 21, 999, 2, -1]` represents an uncompressed array containing a sequence of 4 `1000`s, followed by a sequence of 7 `1050`s, followed by a sequence of 21 `999`s, followed by a sequence of 2 `-1`s.
