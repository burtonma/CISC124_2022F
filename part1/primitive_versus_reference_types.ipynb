    "Notice that in the previous example the *Value* column of the memory diagram no longer contains the address A2530; in other words, there is no longer a reference to the `String` object `\"Gravity is a habit that is hard to shake off.\"`.

In garbage collection, objects that are considered garbage are removed so that the memory that they occupy can be returned to the JVM.

    "1. This notebook claims that \"It is an error to use a `null` reference to invoke a method or to access a field\". The previous statement is not exactly true. Do some research to find out when using `null` to invoke a method actually succeeds.\n",

    "2. Not really an exercise. Readers interested in the history of programming languages and the invention of `null` should consider watching the presentation [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake](htt..//www.infoq.../presentati../Null-References-The-Billion-Dollar-Mistake-Tony-Ho../) by Tony Hoare. Tony Hoare is the inventor of the [quicksort](htt..//en.wikipedia.../w../Quicksort) algorithm and of [Hoare logic](htt..//en.wikipedia.../w../Hoare_logic), which are two topics you might study in your undergraduate degree. Be warned that this is an hour-long presentation."
