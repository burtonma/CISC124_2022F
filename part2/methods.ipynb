    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods are implementations of actions or computations that a class or object can perform. Methods often read or modify the state of an object (i.e., a method often reads or changes the value of one or more fields).\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a class the implementer must decide on what methods the class and instances of the class should be able to perform. The implementer must then decide on what information must be supplied by the caller of the method and what information the method should return to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the term method we usually are referring to *instance methods* which are methods that are associated wtih individual objects of a class; an instance method is able to use the fields of the object that was used to invoke the method in addition to any static fields of the class. A *static method* is a method that belongs to the class that declared the method; a static method can use the static fields of a class."

    "A method declaration defines a method in a class. \n",

    "where *modifiers* are optional method modifiers, *returnType* is the type of the value returned by the method, `methodName` is the name of the method, and *[formalParameterList]* is an optional list of method parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method names follow the same rules and conventions as field names: A method name must begin with a Java letter, the remaining characters in a field name can be made up of any number of Java letters or Java digits, and method names are written using camel case.\n",
