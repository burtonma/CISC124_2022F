    "In the procedure-oriented style of programming that is commonly taught to novice programmers, one fundamental problem that is studied is how to decompose a program into modular, reusable algorithms that are implemented as functions (also called procedures or subroutines). These functions operate on data or data structures that are relevant to the problem being solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, data and the procedures that operate on the data are bundled into objects that are instances of classes. Designing and implementing classes is a fundamental problem in object-oriented programming.\n",

    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "> Abstraction is one of the fundamental ways that we as humans cope with complexity... An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide crisply defined conceptual boundaries, relative to the perspective of the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Booch, G. et al. 2007. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (3rd Edition)]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important aspects of the definition of abstraction quoted above. The first aspect of the definition is that an abstraction is a conceptual model of an idea or thing. When we create a conceptual model of a thing or idea, we tend to make simplifications that capture the important aspects of the thing being modeled while ignoring extraneous details. For example, take a moment to consider creating a conceptual model of an automobile. What attributes of an automobile does your model have? What capabilities does an automobile have in your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible model might have the following attributes for an automobile:\n",
    "\n",
    "* steering wheel\n",
    "* accelerator or gas pedal\n",
    "* brake pedal\n",
    "* 4 wheels\n",
    "* engine\n",
    "* transmission\n",
    "\n",
    "and the autombile might have the following capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* accelerate\n",
    "* slow down\n",
    "* turn left\n",
    "* turn right\n",
    "* switch transmission into Park\n",
    "* switch transmission into Drive\n",
    "* switch transmission into Reverse\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this model omits many details; a modern automobile has [thousands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_auto_parts) of parts and each part may be made up of many subparts. Similarly, the model omits many capabilities of a modern automobile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every driver of an automobile by necessity uses a simplified model of how the automobile actually works. For example, every competent driver knows that if the automobile is moving forwards and the steering is turned clockwise then the car will turn to the right, but no driver thinks about how the steering wheel is actually connected to the wheels via a series of mechanical linkages that may or may not use a variable speed power assist system and how turning the steering wheel by $x$ degrees will cause the wheels to turn by $y$ degrees depending on the current speed of the car and feedback from the electronic traction assist system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second aspect of the definition is that the model of a thing or idea is constructed relative to the perspective of a particular viewer because different viewers will have wildy different needs of the model. Imagine creating a software component that models an automobile for a used automobile sales website; a user of the component will likely want access to information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* make and model year\n",
    "* mileage\n",
    "* condition\n",
    "* appearance\n",
    "* type of vehicle (truck, car, SUV, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now image creating a software component that models an automobile for a video game such as [Mario Kart 8](https://www.mariowiki.com/Mario_Kart_8); a user of the component will likely want access to information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* speed (on ground, water, air, and anti-gravity)\n",
    "* acceleration\n",
    "* handling (on ground, water, air, and anti-gravity)\n",
    "* traction\n",
    "* mini-turbo (or boost)\n",

    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "One definition of encapsulation in object-oriented programming is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Encapsulation is the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Booch, G. et al. 2007. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications (3rd Edition)]\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of encapsulation is that there should be an impenetrable barrier between the user of a component and the implementation details of a component. The user interacts with the component via a fixed, well-defined, public interface without having to rely on knowledge of how the component is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of encapsulation in everyday life are ubiquitous. Consider, for example, a modern smart phone: Almost anyone can learn to operate a smart phone to place a telephone call, take a photograph, or use an app, and the user never needs to know exactly how electrons are flowing through the various circuits of the device to perform these actions, or how the operating system provides programmatic access to the various components of the phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a class is the most common form of encapsulation. Most classes contain data (in the form of fields) that are hidden from users of the class. The user indirectly manipulates the data by invoking public methods each of which should have a well-defined, documented contract (the API of the class). Normally, the user does not know exactly how the method is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is closely related to the principle of *information hiding* which is the principle of hiding components of a program that might change behind a stable interface; if a component needs to be modified then other components that rely on the changed component are not affected because they interact with the changed component only via its stable interface. Information hiding is often applied to Java classes by hiding the fields of an object (by making them `private`) and forcing users of the class to manipulate the fields via `public` methods. This gives the implementer of the class the flexibility to change the way the data in an object is represented without forcing users of the class to modify their code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readers should be aware that some authorities define encapsulation to mean the bundling of data with methods that operate on the data. Using this definition, it is possible to have encapsulation with no information hiding. In Java, this could be done by creating a class where all of the class members (data and methods) are public, and the where the documentation of the class describes the implementation details of the methods. Curious readers may learn more from the article [Encapsulation is not information hiding](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2075271/encapsulation-is-not-information-hiding.html)."

    "\n",
    "> The act of partitioning a program into individual components can reduce its complexity to some degree.... Although partitioning a program is helpful for this reason, a more powerful justification for partitioning a program is that it creates a number of well-defined, documented boundaries within the program. These boundaries, or interfaces, are invaluable in the comprehension of the program\n",

    "\n",
    "Classes and interfaces that are related or rely on one another can be partitioned into Java packages. Classes inside a package can be hidden from other packages by specifying an access modifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Java 9 added yet another level of modularity called (somewhat confusingly) *modules* which are groups of related packages (and other resources). A modules can control how its packages use other modules and a module can control how other modules use its packages. The module system is most useful when developing and maintaining large software systems; for example, the Java platform is partitioned into a large number of modules [listed here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html)."

    "The simplest class that we will design and implement models the idea of a counter.

There are many examples of counters:\n",

    "* test if two counters are equal (have the same value)\n",

    "\n",
    "The reader should keep in mind that there are many other kinds of counters. There are counters that can count in both the upwards and downwards directions (for example, the floor indicator on an elevator). There are counters that can count in increments other than 1 (for example, a counter used to represent scoring in basketball would need to count in increments of 1, 2, and 3). Counters may behave differently when they reach their maximum count value; some counters might stop counting and other counters might indicate some sort of error. The desire to model different types of counters while sharing a common interface and/or implementation leads to idea of inheritance.\n"
