The constructor header and constructor signature for each of its constructors are shown in the following table:\n",

    "| Constructor header | Constructor signature |\n",
    "| :- | :- |\n",
    "|`public HashMap()` | `HashMap()` |\n",

    "The last constructor in the table has a generic parameter of type `Map<? extends K, ? extends V>` which the reader should, for the time being, interpret as meaning \"any `Map` that has the same types of keys and values as the `HashMap` object that is being constructed\". The signature shown in the table is technically the signature *after type erasure*. More information regarding generics in Java can be found the in [Oracle Generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/index.html) tutorial and in Part 3 of the notes. What is important for the time being is that the `HashMap` class cannot have two or more constructors with the signature `HashMap(Map)`."
