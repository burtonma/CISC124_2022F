    "\n",
    "A class declaration defines a new reference type and describes how the type is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a top-level class is a class that is not defined inside another class.\n",
    "In its simplest form, a top-level class declaration looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "modifiers class ClassName {\n",
    "    // inside the braces is called the class body\n",
    "    \n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where *modifiers* are optional class modifiers described below, `class` is a keyword indicating the class declaration, and `ClassName` is the name of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a class name must begin with what is referred to as a *Java letter*. A Java letter includes the characters A-Z, a-z, and for historical reasons the dollar sign `$` and the underscore character `_`; Java letters also include Unicode characters corresponding to letters in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, class names are written using [upper camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case): The first letter of the class name is capitalized, the remaining letters of the name are in lowercase except for multi-word class names where each word also begins with a capital letter. For example, the class name `ArrayList` is used instead of `arraylist`, `Array_List`, `arrayList` or any other variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining characters in a class name can be made up of any number of Java letters or any *Java digits*. A Java digit includes the digits 0-9 and Unicode characters corresponding to digits in other languages."

    "## Class modifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "In a top-level class, the legal class modifiers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `public`\n",
    "- `abstract`\n",
    "- `final`\n",
    "- `strictfp` (we will not use this modifier in any other notebooks)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the time being, the only modifier that is relevant to our purposes is the modifier `public`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `public` class is visible to all other classes and is usually present unless the class is intended to be used inside of a single package (for reasons of modularity). If the `public` modifier is absent from the class declaration then the class is said to have *package private* access which means that the class is only visible inside of the package that it is declared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `abstract` class is an incomplete class that is intended to be used as a super class of an inheritance hierarchy. Abstract classes are discussed in Part 3 of the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `final` class is a class that cannot be extended via inheritance. Final classes are discussed in Part 3 of the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modifier `strictfp` is used to indicate that a class is *FP-strict* which forces all floating-point calculations performed inside the class to adhere to the IEEE754 floating-point standards; this guarantees that floating-point calculations will always yield the same result regardless of the computing platform. On modern computing hardware likely to run Java this no longer seems to be an issue; see [this Java Enhancement Proposal](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/306) for some discussion."
