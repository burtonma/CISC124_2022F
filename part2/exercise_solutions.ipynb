    "1. `Counter` has the invariant that the value of the counter is greater than or equal to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "  `Point2` has no invariants.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `Domino` has two invariants: (1) The smaller value is between 0 and 6, (2) the larger value is between 0 and 6.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `Card` has two invariants: (1) The suit is one of clubs, diamonds, hearts, or spaces, (2) the rank is one of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, jack, queen, king, or ace).\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. `Counter` and `Point2` are mutable. `Domino` and `Card` are immutable based on the description of what a user can do with a domino or card.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There are many possible ways to implement a clock. All of the choices in the question describe possible solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A user should be able to get the elapsed time, start the stopwatch, stop the stopwatch, and reset the stopwatch. Another possible feature is being able to record are retrieve lap times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. An appointment should have a start time and a stop time or duration. An invariant is that the stop time must come after the start time, or the duration must be greater than 0 units of time. Other possible features include a name or description of the appointment, a date for the appointment, and a location.\n",

    "1. The order of the elements is reversed (the element that was on top of the first stack is now on the bottom of the second stack).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `float` values cannot represent all integer values up to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.\n",

    "3. It is not possible to re-assign the value of a `final` field.\n",
    "\n",

    "6. An appointment class would require a field to represent the starting time of the appointment and a second field to represent the end time of the appointment, or a second field that represents the duration of the appointment.
