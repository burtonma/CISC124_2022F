    "2. The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: `(x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0)` implies `x.compareTo(z) > 0`.\n",
    "3. Finally, the implementor must ensure that `x.compareTo(y)==0` implies that `sgn(x.compareTo(z)) == sgn(y.compareTo(z))`, for all `z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation `sgn`(*expression*) denotes the mathematical signum function which returns +1, 0, or -1 if *expression* is positive, zero, or negative, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirement 1 simply states that two objects must agree on their ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirement 2 simply states that if `x` is greater than `y` then `x` is also greater than every object that `y` is greater than.\n",
