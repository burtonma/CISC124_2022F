    "# Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields are used by classes and objects to store information. Fields are also referred to as *member variables* because they can be thought of as variables that are members of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a class the implementer must decide on what information needs to be stored by independent instances of the class. The implementer must then decide on what fields can be used to represent the information needed by the instances. The set of fields and their values are called *the state* of an instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the term field we usually are referring to *instance fields* which are fields that belong to individual objects of a class; that is, every object has its own independent copy of an instance field. A *static field* is a field that belongs to the class that declared the field; only one copy of a static field exists and that copy resides in the class. Objects of the class can access a static field of the class but the same field is shared between all objects of the class."

    "## Declaring fields\n",

    "A field declaration defines the type and name of a field in a class. \n",
    "\n",
    "A field declaration looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "modifiers type fieldName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where *modifiers* are optional field modifiers described below, *type* is the type of the field, and `fieldName` is the name of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, a field name must begin with what is referred to as a *Java letter*. A Java letter includes the characters A-Z, a-z, and for historical reasons the dollar sign `$` and the underscore character `_`; Java letters also include Unicode characters corresponding to letters in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, field names are written using [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case): The first letter of the class name is in lower case, the remaining letters of the name are in lowercase except for multi-word class names where each word also begins with a capital letter. For example, the field name `minVal` is used instead of `Minval`, `min_val`, `MINVAL` or any other variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining characters in a field name can be made up of any number of Java letters or any *Java digits*. A Java digit includes the digits 0-9 and Unicode characters corresponding to digits in other languages.\n",

    "The fields in a class must have unique names."

    "\n",
    "A `public` field is visible to all classes that have access to the class that the field is declared in. Public fields should generally be avoided to ensure proper encapsulation and information hiding. The common exception to this guideline is for fields that represent constant values that users of the class might find useful (e.g., `Math.PI`).\n",
    "\n",
    "A `protected` field is visible to all classes that are in the same package as the class that the field is declared in, and to subclasses of the class that the field is declared in (subject to some restrictions). The `protected` modifier will be discussed in greater detail in Part 3 of the notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A field with no access modifier is said to have *package private* access. The field is visible to all classes in the same package as the class that the field is declared in.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `private` field is visible only in the class that the field is declared in. A useful guideline is to make all fields `private`; only if another class in the same package really needs access to a field should you consider making the field package private.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `static` field belongs to the declaring class. Static fields are discussed in greater detail in the [Static features](./static_features.ipynb#notebook_id) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `final` field can be assigned a value only once; after the field has been assigned a value any attempt to re-assign the value will result in a compile-time error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `transient` field is a field that is not part of the persistent state of an object. In Java an object can be serialized which means that the state of the object is converted into a stream of bytes so that the object can be saved to disk or transmitted over a network connection. Transient fields are not serialized. Interested readers can find more information about serialization from the [Java Object Serialization](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/serialization/index.html) web page.\n",
